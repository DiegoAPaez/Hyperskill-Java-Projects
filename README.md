### Simple Chat Bot
"Begin grasping coding fundamentals by creating a simple console chat bot from scratch. This bot will be able to engage in basic conversation with you and perform simple arithmetic."

### Zookeeper
"Learn the very basics of Java coding by building a simple tool for zookeepers. Get to know how to work with variables, strings and arrays, put them in while loops and develop a simple console app from scratch."

### Cinema Room Manager
"In this project, you will build a program that automates cinema theatre management. You will utilize key Java concepts, including working with input/output operations, handling arrays, creating functions, and using loops and conditional statements."

### Last Pencil
"Playing with friends is pure fun but getting ahead of them is even more enjoyable. Invite a friend to play the Last Pencil, a game where you decide who wins. In this project, your opponent is a computer that is an expert in the game. But it's up to you to choose who wins."

### Coffee Machine
"What can be better than a cup of coffee during a break? A coffee that you don’t have to make yourself. It’s enough to press a couple of buttons on the machine, and you get a cup of energy; but first, we should teach the machine how to do it.

In this project, you'll program a coffee machine simulator using Java. The machine works with typical products: coffee, milk, sugar, and plastic cups; if it runs out of something, it shows a notification. You can get three types of coffee: espresso, cappuccino, and latte. Since nothing’s for free, it also collects the money.

This project allows you to better understand the basic OOP, its main concepts such as classes, class methods and attributes, and get a taste of Java. Practice working with methods, challenge yourself with loops and conditions, and get more confident with OOP."

### Bulls and Cows
"Write your own advanced version of the classic code breaking game "Bulls and Cows". Start with recreating the original version of the game and then take it to a new level."
